## Project 1
This contains the code to load the given data file and make plot. The file "household_power_consumption.txt" is assumed to be in the working directory

## Steps to make the plots
The file "household_power_consumption.txt" should be placed in the working directory along with plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R. Since "data_loading.R" script is sourced in all the plot files, there is no other pre-requisite to make the plots.

## Description of data
The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).

## Data to be used
Data from 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 are used for plotting. Therefore we can read this data directly instead of reading the full data and subsetting it

## Making plots
Base plotting system is used to make plots. Lines are added where they are needed
